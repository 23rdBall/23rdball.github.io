          Welcome to the site comparing two companies:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we got one company, a Japanese one that dealt with publishing magazines, manga, any Japanese media
        </p>
        <h3>Kadokawa Corporation. Shoten. Future Publishing.</h3>
        <img src="https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/common/img/logo_kadokawa.png">
        <p>
          And second, our beloved Texan-based videogame company from 1991 renowned for a famous title..
        </p>
        <h3>id Software</h3>

        <h2>Why did I make this comparison?</h2>
        <p>
          I mainly made this for school. You might not notice, the one you're reading right now is the school version. I have to make two different versions for two different reasons:
          <br>
        <h3>The School Reason</h3>
          <p>
            Like said before, this site was made for school. My teacher wanted me to use code.org, but you know, I'm more familiar with the environment of github. <br>
            (Just don't tell her) <br>
            The full, non-school site is still being worked on by me. And why is this the school version? I have to keep it down to 4 pages, <br>
            and half the content on the non-school site wouldn't be present here.
          </p>
        <h3>The Non-School Reason</h3>
          <p>
            There's two franchises I heard of. <br>
            A video game that was a worldwide success that it set the world on fire burned everything between 1994 to 1995, called DOOM. <br>
            The other one, is an anime that's underrated yet endorsed even by the Japanese gov't and also got a JSDF recruitment poster, called Strike Witches.
          </p>
        </p>
        
        <h2>The point?</h2>
        <p>
